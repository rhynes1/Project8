        <h4>Science Fiction</h4>
        <p>Star Wars, Star Trek, 2001, Battlestar Galactica</p>
        <p>"I have been interested in Science Fiction since I was a kid. I enjoy movies, TV, books, etc. What I enjoy most is the creativity involved and thinking outside of the box. It's both an escape, and a look toward possible future. It expands the mind and help you to understand that your little corner of the world may not be all there is. The type of Sci Fi that I like challenges the mind, as opposed to sheer explosions...though I will admit to enjoying that too.."</p>

      <h4>Father, Son and Holy Spirit</h4>
      <p>The Pinnacle of Life!</p>
      <p>"Since I was 13, Jesus has been shaping me. The Holy Spirit indwells me and the Father is my abba, my closest friend. He comes before my family, my friends and anyone else I've known. He is my past, present and future. Both the natural and supernatural inhabit me and live through me. Healing, prophecy, knowledge and most of all love. Help me to grow, Lord! God is love, he lives in me, which means I should become love and that is my goal, to let Him out"</p>
